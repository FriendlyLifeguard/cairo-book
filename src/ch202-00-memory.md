# Memory

Cairo's memory model is designed to efficiently represent and manage memory access during program execution. Unlike the traditional random access read-write memory model found in most high-level programming languages, Cairo’s memory model is specifically tailored for efficient representation of each memory access for AIR which allows for more streamlined proof generation. 

In this chapter, we will explore the key aspects of Cairo’s memory model, including how values in memory are structured, accessed, and managed.
